# CORRECTNESS
MEETS EXPECTATIONS
Passes most test cases but fails at least one important test case, such as not being able to filter by names and tags at the same time.

For the case of filter by names and tags, you should not returned any student that doesn't match both the name and 
tag (e.g if search by "Skelly Rydings" and "tag1" then Skelly Rydings shouldn't be return if that row didn't contained "tag1", but your app did).
